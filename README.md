# The Conqueror: A Java-Based Strategy Game

## Synopsis

The Conqueror is a turn-based grand strategy game developed entirely in Java. Inspired by classic empire-building titles, the game challenges players to manage resources, build cities, raise armies, and conquer a map of ancient-world powers. Choose a faction, expand your territory, and lead your armies to victory!

This project is a demonstration of core software engineering principles, including Object-Oriented Programming and GUI development, all implemented from the ground up.

## Key Features

*   **Turn-Based Strategy:** Plan your moves, manage your empire, and end your turn to see the world react.
*   **Faction Selection:** Start your journey as one of three iconic cities: Rome, Sparta, or Cairo.
*   **Army Management:** Recruit and command armies composed of three distinct unit types: Archers, Infantry, and Cavalry.
*   **City Development:** Construct a variety of economic and military buildings, including Farms, Markets, Barracks, and Stables, each with unique benefits.
*   **Resource Management:** Balance your treasury (Gold) and food supplies. Levy taxes and harvest food to fund your military and avoid starvation.
*   **World Map & Combat:** Move armies across the map to besiege and attack enemy cities. Engage in an auto-resolved combat system to determine the victor.
*   **Dynamic GUI:** An interactive user interface built with Java Swing allows for intuitive control over all aspects of the game.

## Technical Deep Dive & Architecture

This project was built to showcase robust software architecture and a deep understanding of Java.

*   **Language:** **Java SE**
*   **UI Framework:** **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface.
*   **Design Patterns & Principles:**
    *   **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** The project is cleanly structured to separate concerns:
        *   **Model:** The `engine` package contains all the core game logic, state, and rules (e.g., `Game.java`, `Player.java`, `City.java`). It is completely independent of the user interface.
        *   **View:** The `view` package contains all GUI components, responsible for presenting the game state to the user (e.g., `WorldMap.java`, `CityView.java`).
        *   **Controller:** Event listeners (`ActionListener`) within the view classes handle user input and translate it into actions on the model.
    *   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The game is built on strong OOP principles. Clear class hierarchies are used to model game entities, for example:
        *   `Unit` is the base abstract class for `Archer`, `Infantry`, and `Cavalry`.
        *   `Building` is the base class for `EconomicBuilding` and `MilitaryBuilding`, which are further extended by specific building types like `Farm` and `Barracks`.
    *   **Data-Driven Design:** Initial game setup (e.g., city locations, distances, and starting armies) is loaded from external `.csv` files. This makes the game highly configurable and scalable without altering the source code.
*   **Custom Exception Handling:** A comprehensive custom exception hierarchy is defined in the `exceptions` package. This allows for specific and graceful handling of game-rule violations and invalid user actions (e.g., `NotEnoughGoldException`, `FriendlyCityException`, `MaxLevelException`).

## How to Run the Project

1.  **Compile the code:**
    Navigate to the `src` directory and compile all `.java` files into the `bin` directory.
    ```powershell
    javac -d ../bin ./**/*.java
    ```
2.  **Run the game:**
    Navigate to the `bin` directory and run the main entry point of the application.
    ```powershell
    cd ../bin
    java view.StartScreen
    ```
